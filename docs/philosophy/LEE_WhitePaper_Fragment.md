# Phase-Consistent Logical Inference as Covariant Transformation

## Abstract

This paper introduces a symbolic logic engine, LEE (Logic Evaluation Engine), that models inference not as static derivation, but as a dynamic phase-consistent transformation across covariant logical primitives. Unlike classical systems which treat truth as a Boolean binary, LEE operationalizes truth as an emergent alignment between conjugate symbolic expressions rotating through a logical manifold. This enables a powerful expressive mode in which contradiction, ambiguity, and consequence are resolved through phase rotation — not just evaluation. The result is a lightweight, traceable, expressive engine that delivers both diagnostic and theoretical clarity.

## Core Proposition

We claim that:

> Any logically grounded inference system must support the phase-consistent transformation of mismatched propositions to yield consequence.

This claim is supported by LEE’s novel properties:

- Axiomatic derivation through disjunctive syllogism and phase resolution
- Logical primitives defined as rotation-covariant conjugates
- Symbolic memory trace with exportable `.json`/`.md` formats
- Diagnostic and legal application modules demonstrating real-world logic deployment

## Structure of LEE

LEE consists of:

1. A quantifier-aware symbolic evaluator (`evaluate.py`)
2. A proof engine supporting substitution, pattern matching, and trace export
3. A runtime that resolves goals across scope domains
4. A modular CLI and upcoming REST interface for real-world integration

## Why This Matters

In an age of bloated language models and opaque probabilistic inference, LEE offers:

- Complete symbolic explainability
- Linear runtime behavior
- Formal alignment with philosophical logic, Gödel completeness, and even quantum conjugacy principles

This engine is both a teaching tool and a deployable inference core.

## Who This Is For

- **Philosophers of logic** seeking rigorous counterfactual semantics
- **Diagnostic and legal engineers** needing symbolic trace of consequence
- **Investors and technologists** looking for edge AI infrastructure with explainability by design

We are no longer theorizing. We are running it.
