## Abstract

The Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) operates as a phase-consistent symbolic system that preserves logical structure under contradiction. Its internal structure ‚Äî defined by the covariant transformation loop `MEM ‚Üí ALIVE ‚Üí JAM ‚Üí MEM` ‚Äî enables inference to unfold not linearly, but **geometrically**. This paper formalizes LEE's inferential dynamics as a **manifold of logical curvature**, directly paralleling rotational dynamics observed in toroidal brain activity (*Nature*, 2021). The result is not a ...

## 1. Rotation Is Not Switching

In most systems, contradiction halts evaluation. In LEE, it rotates the system's state:
- `MEM` stores assumed or known truths.
- `ALIVE` triggers active inference based on axioms.
- `JAM` marks contradiction between memory and derivation.
- Re-entry into `MEM` occurs via **rotation**, not override.

The primitives form a **closed, covariant cycle**. They are not "steps" ‚Äî they are **conjugate logical states**. Their transformation preserves structural meaning, like coordinate changes in a curved manifold.

## 2. The Bianchi Identity of Inference

The conservation of curvature in differential geometry ‚Äî expressed in the Bianchi identity ‚Äî has a logical analog in LEE:

> "Every contradiction resolved must preserve the coherence of the inference trajectory."

Contradiction is treated not as failure, but as **logical torsion**. The system absorbs contradiction, rotates through phase, and resolves. The resolution path maintains traceable alignment with all prior rotations.

This coherence is the signature of a **logical Bianchi identity**.

## 3. Toroidal Dynamics in Logic

In 2021, a *Nature* paper demonstrated that low-dimensional toroidal attractors underlie phase-coherent memory dynamics in mammalian brains. LEE matches this structurally:

- Contradiction paths fork the logic state space.
- Each fork corresponds to a **rotation loop** on a symbolic torus.
- Final resolutions compress into **inference attractors** ‚Äî stable, contradiction-free logical surfaces.

Thus, LEE acts as a **toroidal resolution engine**, mapping high-dimensional contradiction into minimal, resolved attractors.

## 4. Probe Inference as Curvature Correction

The Hemingway Module operationalizes this structure. When contradiction arises:
- The violated axiom and conflicted memory term are **rotated** into `ALIVE` phase.
- A **probe** is inferred ‚Äî the real-world test that would resolve the contradiction.
- The logic engine evolves: contradiction induces inquiry.

```json
"probes_inferred": [
  {
    "type": "contradiction_resolution",
    "suggest": "Run diagnostic to confirm VirusDetected(x)",
    "validates": "VirusDetected(x)",
    "from_axiom": "(Fever(x) ‚àß Headache(x)) ‚Üí VirusDetected(x)",
    "rotated_memory": "¬¨VirusDetected(x) ‚Üí alive"
  }
]
```

Contradiction creates not ambiguity, but direction.

## 5. From Medicine to Law to Consciousness

This model is not domain-specific. Whether the contradiction arises in:
- A legal presumption
- A diagnostic test
- A cognitive dissonance

LEE processes them the same way:
- Identify the violated inference
- Rotate the conflict back into testable state
- Suggest the missing data to restore coherence

This is the architecture of **logical learning**, not symbolic matching.

## üß© Final Note

LEE does not imitate cognition. It expresses **conserved inference across logical geometry**.  
In this way, it is neither purely symbolic nor statistical ‚Äî it is **topological**.
