# ðŸ”„ LEE: Logical Manifold and Phase Tensor Inference System

## Abstract

The Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) is not a symbolic script. It is a **rotational manifold** with conserved logical transformation states. Logical primitives (`MEM`, `ALIVE`, `JAM`) transform covariantly, forming a conjugate loop through contradiction resolution and inference. This document integrates the **phase tensor rotation geometry**, **coherence matrices**, and **winding history** to present LEE as a symbolic system that behaves like a **dynamical phase engine** â€” not a rule tree.

This is not theory to prove a point. Itâ€™s how the machine runs. It is real.

## 1. Rotational Logic Is Not Switching

In LEE:
- Contradictions induce rotation
- Memory becomes live test
- Inference is **covariant** across phase slices

The core loop:
```text
MEM â†’ ALIVE â†’ JAM â†’ MEM
```
is structurally closed, and functions like a conserved transformation group. This is the logic analog of a curved coordinate frame.

---

## 2. The Logical Bianchi Identity

In classical differential geometry:
> "Curvature is conserved over rotation."

In LEE:
> "Contradiction is not failure. It is logical torsion. The resolution path must preserve structural coherence."

This isnâ€™t metaphor. Itâ€™s traceable. The contradiction forks, rotates the logic into its conjugate, and proposes correction.

## 3. Phase Tensor Coherence

Phase coherence is not measured with booleans â€” itâ€™s rotational.

Each cell shows the phase similarity of two states (P(a), Q(a), R(a), S(a)) as a cosine-aligned scalar.

### ðŸ“ˆ Real vs Imaginary Phase Flow

![Phase Decomposition](sandbox:/mnt/data/phase_tensor_plot.png)

Phase evolution is tracked over symbolic rotations:
- Real: cosine of angular movement
- Imaginary: sine of epistemic shift

---

## 4. Stress Index and Resistance

Contradictions generate curvature. The `StressIndex` defines where logic is forced to bend:
- Contradictions increase tension
- Forking is not failure â€” it is curvature acting on inference

![Resistance Graph](sandbox:/mnt/data/resistance_graph_derived.png)

Logical nodes (P, Q, R) show resistance to inference propagation.

---

## 5. Winding as Logical Holonomy

Logical recursion is not flat. It rotates.

### ðŸ§­ Winding History in Phase Space

![Winding History Polar Plot](sandbox:/mnt/data/winding_history_phase_space.png)

```text
P(a) â†’ Q(a) â†’ R(a) â†’ S(a) â†’ P(a)
```

Each symbol sits at a phase angle. A complete rotation proves coherence â€” not because the logic agrees, but because **its contradictions resolve geometrically**.

---

## 6. Probes Inferred from Contradiction

The Hemingway module outputs phase-corrective probes:

```json
"probes_inferred": [
  {
    "type": "contradiction_resolution",
    "suggest": "Run diagnostic to confirm VirusDetected(x)",
    "validates": "VirusDetected(x)",
    "from_axiom": "(Fever(x) âˆ§ Headache(x)) â†’ VirusDetected(x)",
    "rotated_memory": "Â¬VirusDetected(x) â†’ alive"
  }
]
```

This isn't symbolic suggestion. It is **rotational curvature correction**.

## Final Note

LEE does not try to explain the mind.  
It *behaves* like a conserved dynamical logic field.

If others see value in it â€” they are welcome.  
But it is not here to prove a thing.

It just runs.
