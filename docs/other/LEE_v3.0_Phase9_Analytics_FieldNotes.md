# LEE v3.0 – Phase 9 Field Notes
**Audience:** Executives (Acies), Technologists (Technoids), Practitioners

---

## 1. Executive Summary (Acies)
Phase 9 integrates **Business Intelligence (BI) analytics, OLAP-like multidimensional analysis, and event metadata mining** into the Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE).  
The purpose is to make LEE's reasoning auditable, explorable, and actionable for decision support.

**Why it matters:**
- Converts raw logical events into **structured decision metrics**.
- Provides **traceability** of inference chains.
- Enables **scenario analysis** and **performance dashboards** for inference runs.

---

## 2. Technical Architecture (Technoids)
### Core Enhancements
- **Event Metadata Layer**: Structured logging of phase transitions (`ALIVE → JAM → MEM`) with timestamps, phase geometry states, and contradiction flags.
- **Data Mart Extraction**: Log output normalized into analytics-friendly schemas (facts + dimensions).
- **OLAP Cubes**: Derived aggregates by:
  - Contradiction type
  - Phase resolution time
  - Logical operator frequency
  - Module-specific activity

**Pipeline Flow:**
1. `evaluate_expression()` / `Pipeline.run()` generates events.
2. `event_log` records normalized entries.
3. Analytics extract runs into external BI/OLAP layer (PowerBI, Tableau, or in-engine Pandas analysis).

---

## 3. Practitioner Workflow
1. **Run Evaluation** as usual.
2. **Export Logs** via `Pipeline.export_log(format="csv")` or `event_log.to_dataframe()`.
3. **Analyze** with:
   - Pivot tables (Excel / LibreOffice)
   - Jupyter Notebooks
   - BI dashboards (pre-built templates provided in `/analytics/bi_templates`)

**Key Use-Cases:**
- Spot **hot paths**: identify inference chains producing the most contradictions.
- Audit **logic health**: monitor % of runs ending in `ALIVE`, `MEM`, `JAM`.
- Compare **model versions** over time for performance regressions.

---

## 4. Next Steps
- Phase 10: Introduce **temporal OLAP** — ability to slice by time intervals during a single inference run.
- Integrate **witness/disjunction property metrics** into analytics schema.
- Publish **Kimball-style star schema** for standardization.
