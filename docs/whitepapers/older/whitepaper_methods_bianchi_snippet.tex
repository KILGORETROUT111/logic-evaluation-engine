\paragraph{Logical Bianchi identity (v2).}
On the directed phase complex with cells for states (\Alive,\Jam,\Mem,\textsf{VAC}) and oriented edges, define a discrete exterior derivative $d_L$ with $d_L^2=0$.
Let $G$ be the curvature-like 2-form (phase tensor aggregate) and $J$ the induced contradiction current.
We enforce $d_L G = 0$ and $d_L J = 0$—``the boundary of a boundary is zero.''
Operationally, we report a residual
\[
\epsilon_B = \big|\,\#\mathrm{enter}(\Jam) - \#\mathrm{exit}(\Jam)\,\big|
\]
as \texttt{bianchi\_residual}; small $\epsilon_B$ is a health criterion.

\textit{Attribution.} The explicit conservation reading and residual construction build on an external contribution (“Revisiting Logical Bianchi Identity”), duly credited. The conjugate-quantities identity and LEE’s original Bianchi analogy remain the author’s prior work.
