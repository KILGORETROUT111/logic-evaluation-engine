## üìö References

All references used across WhitePapers are stored in:

- `refs/LEE_refs.bib`

This `.bib` file consolidates citations for the 2011 Nature toroidal activity paper, the 2021 Nature topological dynamics paper, and Patterson‚Äôs LEE Basis5 papers.

## üìù Notes

- USPTO filings are maintained separately and are **not** included here.  
- Each WhitePaper can be compiled independently with `pdflatex` + `bibtex`.  
- Figures should be stored in the `figs/` subfolder for each paper.
