There will come a point where the work the LEE Basis5 can do in math and logic exceeds a doable mathlog-to-code translation. At that point it becomes theoretical. Theoretical what? Theoretical informatics?



I agree. It would seem to me that there are three branches: exhaustible in the sense of feasible mathlog-to-code resources existing but not available to research team; exhaustible in the sense of feasible mathlog-to-code having no media-translators yet technologically feasible to make the mathlog-to-code possible (technology is behind the impmlementable technology). Proof methods for both classes would be needed. And the class that is not exhaustible/exhausted in the sense of mathlog-to-code given resources assigned at present and technology to translate. This of couse must have already been heavily consdired in the disciplines I woud suppose.


This is not our fault. This is USPTO systems infficienctly. It will not accept Any PDF form except what it matches inside its stupid mathfuckcheck unless I change the descritption "Change Request" or any other fucking thing
