# 🧭 Exhibit B – Hemingway Logic in Action

> This exhibit shows how the Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) executes real-time **phase rotation, contradiction resolution**, and **probe inference**, based on the geometric foundations laid out in the wiki.

## 🔁 Phase Rotation Example (Live CLI Run)

### Input:

- **Symptoms**: `Fever(x)`, `Headache(x)`
- **Memory**: `¬VirusDetected(x)`
- **Axiom**: `(Fever(x) ∧ Headache(x)) → VirusDetected(x)`

### Behavior:

- `ϕ₀`: Derives `VirusDetected(x)` from symptoms
- Contradiction: memory asserts `¬VirusDetected(x)`
- Fork `main_1` in `ϕ₂` is created
- Hemingway logic infers diagnostic probe

## 🔬 Inferred Probe (via Hemingway Module)

```json
"probes_inferred": [
  {
    "type": "contradiction_resolution",
    "suggest": "Run diagnostic to confirm VirusDetected(x)",
    "validates": "VirusDetected(x)",
    "from_axiom": "(Fever(x) ∧ Headache(x)) → VirusDetected(x)",
    "rotated_memory": "¬VirusDetected(x) → alive"
  }
]
```

This proves:
- Contradiction triggers rotational inference
- The system does not halt — it evolves

## 🧩 Conclusion

The Hemingway logic module proves that LEE’s geometry isn’t theoretical — it’s operational.  
Contradictions are testable.  
Memory rotates into inference.  
And logical structure persists through failure.
