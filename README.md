> ‚Äî Billy Joel, [Live in Uniondale (December 29, 1982)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEvqyiRpzE&t=5596s)

This project, like Billy said, is about doing the work right ‚Äî and not taking any crap from anyone: not when they insist on broken logic, bad data, bloated design; and especially not when they think they can talk any shit whatsoever in your presence. You may let them do it; but they'll know you've noted it.

## Executive Summary
The **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)** is a next-generation inference system built on **phase-geometry logic**. It delivers deterministic, reproducible, and measurable reasoning performance ‚Äî across Medical, Legal, and Defense domains ‚Äî without the statistical drift or opaque heuristics common in competing engines.

Where other inference tools produce ‚Äúbest guesses,‚Äù LEE generates **provable reasoning states** with conservation-law properties, making it uniquely suited for high-stakes decisions where accuracy, transparency, and stability matter.

## Why LEE Now
Medical diagnostics, legal analysis, and defense intelligence all face the same core challenge:  
**How do you ensure that your reasoning engine is correct, stable, and explainable ‚Äî every time, under all conditions?**

- Existing category leaders rely on probabilistic or heuristic methods prone to drift.
- Regulatory and operational environments increasingly demand **auditable reasoning**.
- The LEE codebase is **operational today**, grant-ready, and backed by demonstrable metrics from real runs.

---

## Core Innovations
- **Basis5 Phase Geometry** ‚Äî maps material implication truth tables into a rotational phase space.
- **Logical Conservation Laws** ‚Äî including the *Logical Bianchi Identity*, enabling residual checks on reasoning stability.
- **Quantitative Metrics** ‚Äî *StressIndex*, *Resistance*, and *Winding* for live ‚Äúhealth checks‚Äù of reasoning.
- **Provenance Logging** ‚Äî full trace of every reasoning step for audit and legal defensibility.
- **Cross-Domain Transferability** ‚Äî same engine works across medical, legal, and defense without architectural change.

---

## Vertical Applications

### Medical Diagnostics
- Detects **manifold distortions** in reasoning chains that signal diagnostic instability before it surfaces in outputs.
- Flags contradictory evidence integration ‚Äî even when masked by statistical smoothing in other systems.
- Integration: API-level drop-in alongside existing diagnostic inference systems.

### Legal Reasoning
- Quantifies **case health** by measuring contradiction currents and logical manifold strain.
- Produces complete **provenance chains** ‚Äî enabling airtight legal audits.
- Detects adversarial reasoning attempts in litigation or compliance review.

### Defense & Intelligence
- Maintains reasoning stability under **adversarial contradiction injection**.
- Evaluates reliability of intelligence fusion without requiring source model disclosure.
- Integrates with decision-support platforms to deliver **provable reasoning state** outputs.

## Competitive Positioning
| Domain      | Typical Competitors                           | LEE Advantage |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Medical     | Bayesian nets, statistical classifiers        | Deterministic conservation laws, distortion metrics |
| Legal       | Rule-based expert systems, NLP opinion miners | Provable contradiction mapping, provenance integrity |
| Defense     | Probabilistic fusion engines, heuristic DSS   | Adversarial-resistant phase-geometry reasoning |

LEE does not replace vertical-specific tooling ‚Äî it **sits alongside**, evaluates, and can outperform in both stability and auditability.

---

## Maturity & Funding Readiness
- **Status:** Fully functional engine, metrics, provenance, automated tests.
- **Grant-Ready:** Public GitHub release (`v3.1-pre-grant` [See Release v3.1-pre-grant ‚Üí](https://github.com/KILGORETROUT111/logic-evaluation-engine/releases/tag/v3.1-pre-grant)) includes code, docs, and reproducible runs.
- **Next Milestones (6‚Äì12 months):**
  1. Time-weighted StressIndex for temporal instability detection.
  2. Expanded manifold distortion analysis.
  3. Field pilots in medical, legal, and defense environments.
  
---

## Technical Overview (Basis5)

- **Operators:** Covariant in composition, enabling decomposition into disparity and recomposition to full state.
- **Metrics:**  
  - **StressIndex** ‚Äî strain in logical flow.  
  - **Resistance** ‚Äî persistence of strain over cycles.  
  - **Winding** ‚Äî directional characteristics of reasoning flow.  
  - **Bianchi Residual** ‚Äî conservation of contradiction current.

## üì¢ Call for Research Collaboration ‚Äî Neuroscience
LEE‚Äôs phase-geometry inference engine has, in multiple independent runs, produced **toroidal low‚Äìhigh dimensional manifold activity** strikingly consistent with cortical grid-cell dynamics reported in *Nature* (2011, 2024).  
Unlike purely biologically grounded models, LEE was developed independently ‚Äî yet its **compucognitive architecture** naturally generates manifold structures both **within and beyond known cortical constraints**.

Through its **counterfactual multi-object testing** (patients, cases, or plug-in domains), LEE can probe ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù reasoning paths in ways that align with hypothesis generation in experimental neuroscience.  
This raises a compelling possibility: LEE could serve as a **computational discovery tool**, suggesting novel cortical configurations that may later be tested in vivo or in silico.

We invite collaboration with systems neuroscientists, computational modelers, and cognitive architecture researchers to explore:
- How LEE‚Äôs emergent manifolds map to cortical activity patterns
- Whether beyond-topology configurations offer new experimental targets
- How counterfactual manifold analysis could accelerate cortical hypothesis formation

**If your research investigates brain-state manifolds or neural dynamics, LEE may offer a new computational lens to expand your discovery space.**

---

## Next Steps
- Extend vertical partnerships for domain-specific pilots.
- Secure funding to scale compute, optimize engine parameters, and expand metric suite.
- Broaden outreach to regulatory and compliance bodies for early adoption.

# Note on Phase-8 Core Snapshot

## Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) ‚Äî Phase-8 Core Snapshot (.md)

**Scope.** This is a plain-Markdown artifact for academics and engineers.
It documents the Phase-8 core evaluator, the archive/reactivation pathway, the
counterfactual Œî-phase operator, and the deterministic phase history policy.
Images are embedded directly; no LaTeX/PDF pipeline is required.

---

## 0) Quickstart (tests)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine-3.0
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$pwd\src"
pytest -q -rA tests\phase8_acceptance
````

**Expected (current snapshot):** All Phase-8 core tests pass; parser/WHNF tests
may be skipped if `core.parser` is not present on `PYTHONPATH`.

---

## 1) Core Contracts (Operational Summary)

* **Evaluator contract.** On input AST/text, `evaluate_full` **wakes** (MEM‚ÜíALIVE),
  runs contradiction detection, and if a witness exists, **routes ALIVE‚ÜíJAM**, emits
  `{mode, witness}`, archives the artifact, then **JAM‚ÜíMEM**.
* **Invariant I‚ÇÅ (Phase monotonicity).** In a single run, `ALIVE` precedes `JAM`
  precedes `MEM` iff a JAM witness exists.
* **Invariant I‚ÇÇ (Archive completeness).** Every `JAM` event has a persisted archive
  record with `{mode, witness.pattern}` and `{artifact_id}`.
* **Counterfactual policy.** Region-A transformations keep you in A (A‚ÜíA); promotion
  to actionable (A‚ÜíB) happens only under explicit rules.
* **Determinism.** For a fixed input, phase history is deterministic; the trace hash is stable.

---

## 3) Archive & Reactivation (JAM‚ÜíMEM‚ÜíALIVE)

* **When `analyze(expr)` finds a contradiction**, the engine:

  1. logs `Event("JAM", {"mode": <local-refutation|implication-jam>, "archived_id": <UUID>})`
  2. persists archive record via `core.archive.store`,
  3. transitions `JAM‚ÜíMEM`.
* **Reactivation:** `core.archive.reactivate(artifact_id, rules_prime)` replays
  the artifact in a patched context, returning a fresh trace that **begins in ALIVE**.

**Minimal JAM example (implication row):**

```python
expr = ("IMP", ("CONST", 1), ("CONST", 0))  # canonical (1 ‚Üí 0)
t = evaluate_full(expr)
# t.events includes ALIVE, JAM(payload={"mode": "implication-jam", "archived_id": ...}), MEM
```

---

## 4) Counterfactuals & Œî-phase

* **A‚ÜíA**: negated/hypothetical inputs remain in Region-A with preserved form.
* **Promotion boundary**: rules may escalate A‚ÜíB when an actionable entailment is met.
* **Œî-phase operator**: exports the *symbolic distance* between worlds; shape verified by tests.

---

## 5) Determinism & Error Policy

* **Deterministic phase history:** identical inputs ‚Üí identical phase sequences; we pin this
  with a `trace_hash` over the phase stream.
* **Error‚ÜíJAM policy:** well-typed operational errors are surfaced as JAM (with witness payload).

## 6) JSON Snapshot (for notebooks, BI, or docs)

Generate a compact, UTF-8 snapshot of Phase-8 canonical cases:

```

**Snapshot shape (excerpt):**

    "expr": ["IMP", ["CONST", 1], ["CONST", 0]],
    "trace": [
      {"phase": "ALIVE", "payload": {}},
      {"phase": "JAM", "payload": {"mode": "implication-jam", "archived_id": "..." }},
      {"phase": "MEM",  "payload": {}}
    ],
    "witness": {"is_contradiction": true, "mode": "implication-jam", "witness": ["IMP", ["CONST", 1], ["CONST", 0]]},
    "trace_hash": "‚Ä¶"
  },
  "local_refutation": { "expr": ["AND", ["VAR", "x"], ["NOT", ["VAR", "x"]]], "...": "‚Ä¶" }
}

## 7) Commands (one-liners you can copy/paste)

* **Run core acceptance tests**

  ```powershell
  $env:PYTHONPATH = "$pwd\src"
  pytest -q -rA tests\phase8_acceptance
  ```

* **Export Phase-8 snapshot JSON**

  ```powershell
  python tools\phase8_summarize.py > docs\whitepapers\LEE_Paper\build\phase8_snapshot.json
  ```

---

## 8) What‚Äôs in / What‚Äôs deferred

* **In (Phase-8 core)**: canonicalization‚Üíwitness‚ÜíJAM‚Üíarchive‚ÜíMEM, reactivation path,
  Œî-phase counterfactuals (A‚ÜíA, promotion boundary), deterministic phase history.
* **Deferred (Phase-9 analytics)**: OLAP cubes, temporal slicing, BI dashboards.
  Kept out of core to preserve the invariants and keep tests fast.

---

## 9) Provenance & Expectations

Nothing in LEE is coded unless it is **self-projected by MathLog and first principles**:
the code mirrors the kernel‚Äôs four-phase semantics, witness calculus, and archive contract.
This `.md` is the running ledger for that alignment.

# Tiny README snippet ‚Äî ‚ÄúTensor Semantics in LEE‚Äù

```md
## Tensor Semantics in LEE (Phase-8b)


LEE‚Äôs phase manifold is taken (for core purposes) as a 2-D torus \(M \cong \mathbb{T}^2\).  
We expose **tensor *types*** (not numeric components) to keep the core evaluator geometrically disciplined.

**Field types (meta):**
- `EntropyLoad` (EL): scalar \((0,0)\)
- `PhaseFlow`: vector \((1,0)\)
- `DTM_dir`: covector \((0,1)\)
- `J_contra`: contradiction flux, 2-form \((0,2)\), antisymmetric
- `Stress2Form`: stress diagnostic, 2-form \((0,2)\), antisymmetric

**Invariants (meta-level):**
1. **Type stability under reparametrization**: coordinate changes (e.g., \(\phi \mapsto \phi+\alpha\)) preserve variance \((p,q)\), symmetry, and dimension exponent.
2. **Wedge discipline**: \( (0,1)\wedge(0,1) \to (0,2) \) with antisymmetry.
3. **Dimension bookkeeping**: exponents add under tensor product; core fields use exponent \(0\). (Nonzero exponents are reserved for verticals.)

**DTM policy (core vs vertical):**
`DTM_dir` remains *out of core* unless the evaluator **actually consults it to decide/modify** a legal phase transition (e.g., to damp a high-torsion JAM‚ÜíMEM). If consulted, DTM becomes ‚Äúis-in (core)‚Äù per the Phase-8b rule.

See `src/core/tensor.py` and `tests/phase8b_tensor_semantics.py`.

# Tensor Semantics in LEE (Phase-8b)

**Scope.** This document specifies the meta-level tensor discipline used by LEE‚Äôs core evaluator. We model *types* (rank/variance, symmetry, dimension exponents) on the phase manifold \(M \cong \mathbb{T}^2\). Numeric components, metrics, and Hodge duals are deferred to verticals.

---

## Files

- `src/core/tensor.py` ‚Äî minimal API for tensor *metadata*:
  - `FieldMeta`: `(name, variance=(p,q), symmetry, dimension_exp, chart)`
  - helpers: `tensor_product_meta`, `wedge_meta`, `grad_meta`, `div_meta`,
    `reparam_phi_shift_meta`
  - conveniences: `EL_meta`, `phase_flow_meta`, `DTM_dir_meta`,
    `contradiction_flux_meta`, `stress_2form_meta`
- `tests/phase8b_tensor_semantics.py` ‚Äî acceptance tests (A‚ÄìF)

---

## Design goals

1. **Geometric discipline for the core.** Keep the evaluator honest about what objects it produces/consumes across phase transitions.
2. **Separation of concerns.** Core uses only *dimensionless* types (exponent \(0\)); verticals (physics/biomed) may introduce nonzero exponents.
3. **Future-proofing.** The API anticipates adding numeric components, connections, and integrals without breaking core contracts.

## Core types

| Name                  | Variance | Symmetry  | Dim. exp. | Meaning                                    |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|-----------:|--------------------------------------------|
| `EntropyLoad` (EL)    | (0,0)    | none      |        0.0 | scalar load functional on \(M\)            |
| `PhaseFlow`           | (1,0)    | none      |        0.0 | vector field for phase transport           |
| `DTM_dir`             | (0,1)    | none      |        0.0 | diagnostic torsion direction (1-form)      |
| `J_contra`            | (0,2)    | antisym   |        0.0 | contradiction flux 2-form                  |
| `Stress2Form`         | (0,2)    | antisym   |        0.0 | stress diagnostic 2-form                   |

> **Note (DTM policy).** `DTM_dir` is *not* ‚Äúis-in (core)‚Äù unless the evaluator actually consults it to choose/modify a legal phase transition. Once consulted, it becomes core per the formal rule:
>
> \[
> X \in \text{core} \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \frac{\partial\,\textsf{Eval}}{\partial X}\neq 0 \;\;\lor\;\; X\text{ is needed to prove } I_1\text{‚Äì}I_6 \text{ about }\textsf{Eval}.

## API sketch

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class FieldMeta:
    name: str                   # label for diagnostics
    variance: tuple[int,int]    # (p,q) = (# contravariant, # covariant)
    symmetry: "none|sym|antisym"
    dimension_exp: float        # exponent under L -> ŒªL scaling
    chart: str = "theta,phi"    # coordinate tag (purely informational)

# Type algebra
tensor_product_meta(a, b) -> FieldMeta          # (p,q) add; exponents add
wedge_meta(a, b) -> FieldMeta                   # (0,1) ^ (0,1) -> (0,2) antisym

# Flat T^2 differential *meta* (types only)
grad_meta(scalar) -> (0,1)
div_meta(vector)  -> (0,0)

# Coordinate reparametrization invariance (meta-level type preservation)
reparam_phi_shift_meta(meta, shift) -> meta
````

---

## Acceptance tests (A‚ÄìF)

* **A. Type/dimension algebra.** `grad(EL):(0,1)`, `div(PhaseFlow):(0,0)`, product adds variances and exponents.
* **B. Wedge discipline.** `(0,1) ‚àß (0,1) ‚Üí (0,2)` with antisymmetry.
* **C. Coordinate covariance (meta).** Reparametrization preserves variance, symmetry, exponent.
* **D. Syntactic gauge (Œ±-rename) placeholder.** Meta unaffected by naming.
* **E. Integral well-posedness (meta).** Only 2-forms are integrable over area (e.g., `J_contra`, `Stress2Form`).
* **F. Unit rescale sanity.** Core fields use exponent 0; verticals may set nonzero.

---

## Worked mini-examples

### 1) Contradiction flux as a 2-form

To integrate a contradiction flux over a patch $U \subset M$, its *type* must be $(0,2)$ antisymmetric:

```python
J = contradiction_flux_meta()      # (0,2), antisym
assert J.is_2form()
# Later vertical can attach numeric components and compute ‚à´_U J.
```

### 2) DTM-gated phase damping (conditional core)

If the evaluator uses `DTM_dir` to damp a high-torsion JAM‚ÜíMEM step (e.g., threshold on a torsion score), then $ \partial \textsf{Eval}/\partial \text{DTM\_dir}\neq 0$ and DTM becomes ‚Äúis-in (core)‚Äù per Phase-8b.

---

## Running the tests

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine-3.0
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$pwd\src"
pytest -q -rA tests\phase8b_tensor_semantics.py
```

**Unix-like:**

```bash
cd logic-evaluation-engine-3.0
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q -rA tests/phase8b_tensor_semantics.py
```

Tests will `skip` cleanly if `core/tensor.py` is missing.

![phase8b_plan](https://github.com/KILGORETROUT111/logic-evaluation-engine/blob/v3.0/docs/phase8b_plan.md]"phase8bplan")
---

## Roadmap (post-8b)

* Attach numeric components and simple pullbacks on $\mathbb{T}^2$.
* Optional metric $g$ and Hodge star $\star$ for 1-forms/2-forms.
* Basic Stokes checks for the JAM archive boundary (line integral vs flux).
* Bridge to analytics: log field *types* alongside event traces.

---

## Rationale

* Keeps the core evaluator‚Äôs reasoning **coordinate-honest** without dragging in heavy differential-geometric machinery.
* Clean boundary between **pedagogy/research** and **verticals**: academics can reason about types/invariants; engineering pipelines can later add units and numerics without weakening proofs or contracts.
