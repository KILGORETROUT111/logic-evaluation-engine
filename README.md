This project, like Billy said, is about doing the work right ‚Äî and not taking any crap from anyone: not when they insist on broken logic, bad data, bloated design; and especially not when they think they can talk any shit whatsoever in your presence. You may let them do it; but they'll know you've noted it.

## Executive Summary
The **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)** is a next-generation inference system built on **phase-geometry logic**. It delivers deterministic, reproducible, and measurable reasoning performance ‚Äî across Medical, Legal, and Defense domains ‚Äî without the statistical drift or opaque heuristics common in competing engines.

Where other inference tools produce ‚Äúbest guesses,‚Äù LEE generates **provable reasoning states** with conservation-law properties, making it uniquely suited for high-stakes decisions where accuracy, transparency, and stability matter.

## Why LEE Now
Medical diagnostics, legal analysis, and defense intelligence all face the same core challenge:  
**How do you ensure that your reasoning engine is correct, stable, and explainable ‚Äî every time, under all conditions?**

- Existing category leaders rely on probabilistic or heuristic methods prone to drift.
- Regulatory and operational environments increasingly demand **auditable reasoning**.
- The LEE codebase is **operational today**, grant-ready, and backed by demonstrable metrics from real runs.

---

## Core Innovations
- **Basis5 Phase Geometry** ‚Äî maps material implication truth tables into a rotational phase space.
- **Logical Conservation Laws** ‚Äî including the *Logical Bianchi Identity*, enabling residual checks on reasoning stability.
- **Quantitative Metrics** ‚Äî *StressIndex*, *Resistance*, and *Winding* for live ‚Äúhealth checks‚Äù of reasoning.
- **Provenance Logging** ‚Äî full trace of every reasoning step for audit and legal defensibility.
- **Cross-Domain Transferability** ‚Äî same engine works across medical, legal, and defense without architectural change.

---

## Vertical Applications

### Medical Diagnostics
- Detects **manifold distortions** in reasoning chains that signal diagnostic instability before it surfaces in outputs.
- Flags contradictory evidence integration ‚Äî even when masked by statistical smoothing in other systems.
- Integration: API-level drop-in alongside existing diagnostic inference systems.

### Legal Reasoning
- Quantifies **case health** by measuring contradiction currents and logical manifold strain.

## Competitive Positioning
| Domain      | Typical Competitors                           | LEE Advantage |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Medical     | Bayesian nets, statistical classifiers        | Deterministic conservation laws, distortion metrics |
| Legal       | Rule-based expert systems, NLP opinion miners | Provable contradiction mapping, provenance integrity |
| Defense     | Probabilistic fusion engines, heuristic DSS   | Adversarial-resistant phase-geometry reasoning |

LEE does not replace vertical-specific tooling ‚Äî it **sits alongside**, evaluates, and can outperform in both stability and auditability.

## üì¢ Call for Research Collaboration ‚Äî Neuroscience
LEE‚Äôs phase-geometry inference engine has, in multiple independent runs, produced **toroidal low‚Äìhigh dimensional manifold activity** strikingly consistent with cortical grid-cell dynamics reported in *Nature* (2011, 2024).  
Unlike purely biologically grounded models, LEE was developed independently ‚Äî yet its **compucognitive architecture** naturally generates manifold structures both **within and beyond known cortical constraints**.

Through its **counterfactual multi-object testing** (patients, cases, or plug-in domains), LEE can probe ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù reasoning paths in ways that align with hypothesis generation in experimental neuroscience.  
This raises a compelling possibility: LEE could serve as a **computational discovery tool**, suggesting novel cortical configurations that may later be tested in vivo or in silico.

We invite collaboration with systems neuroscientists, computational modelers, and cognitive architecture researchers to explore:
- How LEE‚Äôs emergent manifolds map to cortical activity patterns
- Whether beyond-topology configurations offer new experimental targets
- How counterfactual manifold analysis could accelerate cortical hypothesis formation

**If your research investigates brain-state manifolds or neural dynamics, LEE may offer a new computational lens to expand your discovery space.**

---

## Next Steps
- Extend vertical partnerships for domain-specific pilots.
- Secure funding to scale compute, optimize engine parameters, and expand metric suite.
- Broaden outreach to regulatory and compliance bodies for early adoption.

# Note on Phase-8 Core Snapshot

## Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) ‚Äî Phase-8 Core Snapshot (.md)

**Scope.** This is a plain-Markdown artifact for academics and engineers.
It documents the Phase-8 core evaluator, the archive/reactivation pathway, the
counterfactual Œî-phase operator, and the deterministic phase history policy.
Images are embedded directly; no LaTeX/PDF pipeline is required.

---

## 0) Quickstart (tests)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine-3.0
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$pwd\src"
pytest -q -rA tests\phase8_acceptance
````

**Expected (current snapshot):** All Phase-8 core tests pass; parser/WHNF tests
may be skipped if `core.parser` is not present on `PYTHONPATH`.

---

## 1) Core Contracts (Operational Summary)

* **Evaluator contract.** On input AST/text, `evaluate_full` **wakes** (MEM‚ÜíALIVE),
  runs contradiction detection, and if a witness exists, **routes ALIVE‚ÜíJAM**, emits
  `{mode, witness}`, archives the artifact, then **JAM‚ÜíMEM**.
* **Invariant I‚ÇÅ (Phase monotonicity).** In a single run, `ALIVE` precedes `JAM`
  precedes `MEM` iff a JAM witness exists.
* **Invariant I‚ÇÇ (Archive completeness).** Every `JAM` event has a persisted archive
  record with `{mode, witness.pattern}` and `{artifact_id}`.
* **Counterfactual policy.** Region-A transformations keep you in A (A‚ÜíA); promotion
  to actionable (A‚ÜíB) happens only under explicit rules.
* **Determinism.** For a fixed input, phase history is deterministic; the trace hash is stable.

## 3) Archive & Reactivation (JAM‚ÜíMEM‚ÜíALIVE)

* **When `analyze(expr)` finds a contradiction**, the engine:

  1. logs `Event("JAM", {"mode": <local-refutation|implication-jam>, "archived_id": <UUID>})`
  2. persists archive record via `core.archive.store`,
  3. transitions `JAM‚ÜíMEM`.
* **Reactivation:** `core.archive.reactivate(artifact_id, rules_prime)` replays
  the artifact in a patched context, returning a fresh trace that **begins in ALIVE**.

**Minimal JAM example (implication row):**

```python
expr = ("IMP", ("CONST", 1), ("CONST", 0))  # canonical (1 ‚Üí 0)
t = evaluate_full(expr)
# t.events includes ALIVE, JAM(payload={"mode": "implication-jam", "archived_id": ...}), MEM
```

---

## 4) Counterfactuals & Œî-phase

* **A‚ÜíA**: negated/hypothetical inputs remain in Region-A with preserved form.
* **Promotion boundary**: rules may escalate A‚ÜíB when an actionable entailment is met.
* **Œî-phase operator**: exports the *symbolic distance* between worlds; shape verified by tests.

---

## 5) Determinism & Error Policy

* **Deterministic phase history:** identical inputs ‚Üí identical phase sequences; we pin this
  with a `trace_hash` over the phase stream.
* **Error‚ÜíJAM policy:** well-typed operational errors are surfaced as JAM (with witness payload).

## 6) JSON Snapshot (for notebooks, BI, or docs)

Generate a compact, UTF-8 snapshot of Phase-8 canonical cases:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine-3.0
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$pwd\src"
python tools\phase8_summarize.py > docs\whitepapers\LEE_Paper\build\phase8_snapshot.json
```

**Snapshot shape (excerpt):**

```json
{
  "implication_jam": {
    "expr": ["IMP", ["CONST", 1], ["CONST", 0]],
    "trace": [
      {"phase": "ALIVE", "payload": {}},
      {"phase": "JAM", "payload": {"mode": "implication-jam", "archived_id": "..." }},
      {"phase": "MEM",  "payload": {}}
    ],
    "witness": {"is_contradiction": true, "mode": "implication-jam", "witness": ["IMP", ["CONST", 1], ["CONST", 0]]},
    "trace_hash": "‚Ä¶"
  },
  "local_refutation": { "expr": ["AND", ["VAR", "x"], ["NOT", ["VAR", "x"]]], "...": "‚Ä¶" }
}
```

  ```powershell
  python tools\phase8_summarize.py > docs\whitepapers\LEE_Paper\build\phase8_snapshot.json
  ```

## 8) What‚Äôs in / What‚Äôs deferred

* **In (Phase-8 core)**: canonicalization‚Üíwitness‚ÜíJAM‚Üíarchive‚ÜíMEM, reactivation path,
  Œî-phase counterfactuals (A‚ÜíA, promotion boundary), deterministic phase history.
* **Deferred (Phase-9 analytics)**: OLAP cubes, temporal slicing, BI dashboards.
  Kept out of core to preserve the invariants and keep tests fast.

## 9) Provenance & Expectations

Nothing in LEE is coded unless it is **self-projected by MathLog and first principles**:
the code mirrors the kernel‚Äôs four-phase semantics, witness calculus, and archive contract.
This `.md` is the running ledger for that alignment.
