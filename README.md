# Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)

## Executive Summary
The **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)** is a next-generation inference system built on **phase-geometry logic**. It delivers deterministic, reproducible, and measurable reasoning performance — across Medical, Legal, and Defense domains — without the statistical drift or opaque heuristics common in competing engines.

Where other inference tools produce “best guesses,” LEE generates **provable reasoning states** with conservation-law properties, making it uniquely suited for high-stakes decisions where accuracy, transparency, and stability matter.

## Why LEE Now
Medical diagnostics, legal analysis, and defense intelligence all face the same core challenge:  
**How do you ensure that your reasoning engine is correct, stable, and explainable — every time, under all conditions?**

- Existing category leaders rely on probabilistic or heuristic methods prone to drift.
- Regulatory and operational environments increasingly demand **auditable reasoning**.
- The LEE codebase is **operational today**, grant-ready, and backed by demonstrable metrics from real runs.

## Core Innovations
- **Basis5 Phase Geometry** — maps material implication truth tables into a rotational phase space.
- **Logical Conservation Laws** — including the *Logical Bianchi Identity*, enabling residual checks on reasoning stability.
- **Quantitative Metrics** — *StressIndex*, *Resistance*, and *Winding* for live “health checks” of reasoning.
- **Provenance Logging** — full trace of every reasoning step for audit and legal defensibility.
- **Cross-Domain Transferability** — same engine works across medical, legal, and defense without architectural change.

## Vertical Applications

### Medical Diagnostics
- Detects **manifold distortions** in reasoning chains that signal diagnostic instability before it surfaces in outputs.
- Flags contradictory evidence integration — even when masked by statistical smoothing in other systems.
- Integration: API-level drop-in alongside existing diagnostic inference systems.

### Legal Reasoning
- Quantifies **case health** by measuring contradiction currents and logical manifold strain.
- Produces complete **provenance chains** — enabling airtight legal audits.
- Detects adversarial reasoning attempts in litigation or compliance review.

### Defense & Intelligence
- Maintains reasoning stability under **adversarial contradiction injection**.
- Evaluates reliability of intelligence fusion without requiring source model disclosure.
- Integrates with decision-support platforms to deliver **provable reasoning state** outputs.

## Competitive Positioning
| Domain      | Typical Competitors                           | LEE Advantage |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Medical     | Bayesian nets, statistical classifiers        | Deterministic conservation laws, distortion metrics |
| Legal       | Rule-based expert systems, NLP opinion miners | Provable contradiction mapping, provenance integrity |
| Defense     | Probabilistic fusion engines, heuristic DSS   | Adversarial-resistant phase-geometry reasoning |

LEE does not replace vertical-specific tooling — it **sits alongside**, evaluates, and can outperform in both stability and auditability.

## Maturity & Funding Readiness
- **Status:** Fully functional engine, metrics, provenance, automated tests.
- **Grant-Ready:** Public GitHub release (`v3.1-pre-grant`) includes code, docs, and reproducible runs.
- **Next Milestones (6–12 months):**
  1. Time-weighted StressIndex for temporal instability detection.
  2. Expanded manifold distortion analysis.
  3. Field pilots in medical, legal, and defense environments.

## Technical Overview (Basis5)
- **Primitives:** `Alive`, `Jam`, `Mem`, `Vac` — derived from material implication truth tables.
- **Geometry:** Phase-rotation mapping enables detection of conserved and distorted states.
- **Operators:** Covariant in composition, enabling decomposition into disparity and recomposition to full state.
- **Metrics:**  
  - **StressIndex** — strain in logical flow.  
  - **Resistance** — persistence of strain over cycles.  
  - **Winding** — directional characteristics of reasoning flow.  
  - **Bianchi Residual** — conservation of contradiction current.

---

## Next Steps
- Extend vertical partnerships for domain-specific pilots.
- Secure funding to scale compute, optimize engine parameters, and expand metric suite.
- Broaden outreach to regulatory and compliance bodies for early adoption.
