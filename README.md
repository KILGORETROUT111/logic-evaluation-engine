### **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE).**

LEE v1.2 is the first logic engine to introduce a rotational phase-state geometry for logical primitives. This allows for inference under misalignment — where memory, contradiction, or uncertainty are not obstacles, but coherent states in a structured dynamic. The model does not guess; it rotates. LEE’s architecture supports traceable evaluation, modal diagnostics, and counterfactual inference — and v1.2 introduces stable diagnostic pipelines that show phase resolution in action. This is not a claim of completeness. It is a quiet submission of structural novelty.

> *“LEE is not just logic. It is rotational inference under contradiction.”*

The **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)** is a symbolic reasoning engine built for phase-resolved inference, contradiction handling, and diagnostic logic across domains like **law**, **medicine**, and **autonomous systems**. It resolves symbolic contradictions not by discarding them, but by rotating their phase-state — traversing through **memory (mem)**, **testability (alive)**, **contradiction (jam)**, and **back to memory** — thereby preserving coherence in uncertain or incomplete environments.

LEE creates a new frontier in formal logic computation:

### 🌀 Key Capabilities

- Forked phase-state logic for contradictory or underdetermined inputs  
- Diagnostic engine with memory rotation and probe suggestion  
- CLI and REST API interfaces for embedding or operational testing  
- SVG / JSON / TXT outputs for analysis, audits, and traceability  
- Conjugate primitive architecture (mem > alive > jam > mem)  
- Tensor-style contradiction trace and semantic rotation  
- Medical and legal demos: LEE can both *diagnose* and *disqualify* by logic

## 🧭 LEE’s Position in the Landscape of Theoretical Logic and Physics

**LEE is not a critique. It is a constructive logic that makes collapse unnecessary.**

Where theoretical physicists and philosophers of logic have debated realism, observer dependence, and quantum collapse, LEE simply builds its own frame:

- No observer required.
- No stochastic collapse invoked.
- No untraceable inference.

Instead:
- Logical contradiction becomes a tensor field.
- Phase is operationally real, complex-valued, and spatially conserved.
- JAM → MEM → ALIVE replaces collapse with a dynamic resolution cycle.

LEE’s innovation is not just in the claim — it’s in the code.

### 🔐 License & Disclosure

This software is released under the  
**Logic Evaluation Engine – Limited Demonstration and Diagnostic License (LEE-LDDL v1.0)**.

Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) is a symbolic inference system for contradiction-aware reasoning under uncertainty. It rotates through logical phase states — memory, testability, contradiction, and resolution — to expose hidden inconsistencies and generate structured diagnostic traces.
