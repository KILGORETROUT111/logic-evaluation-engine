### **Logic Evaluation Engine LEE: Toroidal Logic Engine — Canonical Brief (LEE).**

In LEE, canonical is not declared; it is projected. Only what survives phase rotation, self-consistency, and executable testing is conserved as “truth.” All else is advisory.
Contradiction is logical torsion, not failure: the mathematics literally curves inference into place, maintaining conservation across all transformations. LEE’s architecture independently manifests the same toroidal geometry observed in mammalian brain dynamics (Nature, 2021), but in explicit, auditable logic.

LEE is not here and does not exist to prove a point. It is here to function. The system either works or it does not. Its reality is in operation, not in argument.

### **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE).**

### **Covariant Phase-State Dynamics for Symbolic Inference.**

LEE (Logic Evaluation Engine) is a logic-first inference engine designed to handle symbolic contradiction, diagnostic reasoning, and counterfactual inference under phase-consistent transformation rules. It treats symbolic logic as a conserved, covariant field and supports rotational logic state handling through custom primitives.

The **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)** is a symbolic reasoning engine built for phase-resolved inference, contradiction handling, and diagnostic logic across domains like **law**, **medicine**, and **autonomous systems**. It resolves symbolic contradictions not by discarding them, but by rotating their phase-state — traversing through **memory (mem)**, **testability (alive)**, **contradiction (jam)**, and **back to memory** — thereby preserving coherence in uncertain or incomplete environments.

LEE v1.2 is the first logic engine to introduce a rotational phase-state geometry for logical primitives. This allows for inference under misalignment — where memory, contradiction, or uncertainty are not obstacles, but coherent states in a structured dynamic. The model does not guess; it rotates. LEE’s architecture supports traceable evaluation, modal diagnostics, and counterfactual inference — and v1.2 introduces stable diagnostic pipelines that show phase resolution in action. This is not a claim of completeness. It is a quiet submission of structural novelty.

LEE creates a new frontier in formal logic computation:

### 🌀 Key Capabilities

- Forked phase-state logic for contradictory or underdetermined inputs  
- Diagnostic engine with memory rotation and probe suggestion  
- CLI and REST API interfaces for embedding or operational testing  
- SVG / JSON / TXT outputs for analysis, audits, and traceability  
- Conjugate primitive architecture (mem > alive > jam > mem)  
- Tensor-style contradiction trace and semantic rotation  
- Medical and legal demos: LEE can both *diagnose* and *disqualify* by logic

  ## 🔁 Diagnostic Logic Engine: System Overview

### 1. Live Observation Stream

- Incoming symptom or event observations (e.g., `{"patient_id": "P003", "symptom": "fever", "phase": "initial"}`) are timestamped and assigned a confidence level.
- These are routed through a `symptom_feed.py` parser or CLI ingestion into the evaluation pipeline.

### 2. Memory Model

- Each patient has a unique record (`/jam_store/memdb/P003.json`), storing past observations in a chronological memory stack.
- Observations are written using `memory_push()` and retrieved with `memory_lookup()`.
- This enables stateful diagnostic evaluation — context-sensitive to prior events.

### 3. Evaluation Logic

- Core logic resides in `diagnostic_phase_engine.py` and its logic module.
- It resolves the new input against memory using symbolic reasoning.
- Outcomes:
  - `{"status": "resolved", "diagnosis": "Likely measles"}`
  - `{"status": "jammed", "trace": {"contradiction": True, "conflict": ("fever", "hypothermia")}}`

### 4. JAM Detection and Archive

- Contradictory logic states (e.g., hypothermia after fever in same phase vector) are JAMMED.
- JAMs are stored as JSON files with rich metadata in `/jam_store/jam_dump/`.
- Each JAM has a unique file ID (e.g., `JAM_P003_hypothermia_2025-07-28T16-32-01.840375.json`).
- Archive includes:
  ```json
  {
    "patient_id": "P003",
    "symptom": "hypothermia",
    "phase": "recall",
    "result": {
      "contradiction": true,
      "conflict": ["fever", "hypothermia"]
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-07-28T16:32:01.840375"
  }
  ```

### 5. SVG Rendering

- The JAM is visually rendered using `visualize_archive.py` and `render_patient_phase_flow.py`.
- Diagrams include directional arrows, color-coded regions (MEM → ALIVE → JAM), and patient flows.
- Phase lattices are saved as SVGs into `/evaluation/jam_store/svg_out/`.
- CLI-trigger or hybrid modes supported.

### 6. Upcoming: Timeline Replay + Re-evaluation

- We are now wiring the ability to:
  - Reconstruct a patient’s timeline from memory.
  - Replay it step-by-step into the diagnostic engine.
  - Trigger reevaluation for future hypothetical/retrospective analysis.

This capability will enable advanced use in medical, legal, and defense verticals.

## 🧭 LEE’s Position in the Landscape of Theoretical Logic and Physics

**LEE is not a critique. It is a constructive logic that makes collapse unnecessary.**

Where theoretical physicists and philosophers of logic have debated realism, observer dependence, and quantum collapse, LEE simply builds its own frame:

- No observer required.
- No stochastic collapse invoked.
- No untraceable inference.

Instead:
- Logical contradiction becomes a tensor field.
- Phase is operationally real, complex-valued, and spatially conserved.
- JAM → MEM → ALIVE replaces collapse with a dynamic resolution cycle.

LEE’s innovation is not just in the claim — it’s in the code.
