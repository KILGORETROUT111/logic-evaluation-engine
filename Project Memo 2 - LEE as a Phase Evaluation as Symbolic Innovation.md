# Project Memo 2: Phase Evaluation as Symbolic Innovation in LEE

The Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) introduces a novel yet grounded structure for symbolic evaluation by layering four state phases — **ALIVE**, **MEM**, **JAM**, and **VAC** — onto classical logic expression evaluation. These phases are not merely error or status codes; they represent a **rotational logic schema** that marks the progress, coherence, failure, or deferral of logical inference.

Unlike traditional two-valued truth systems or monadic error-handling schemes, LEE exposes the path of evaluation as a structured trace, useful in teaching, debugging, and understanding recursive or modal logic systems.

## How LEE Differs from Existing Systems

Comparative analysis reveals that LEE is **not duplicating** the architecture of existing systems:

- It is **more structurally explicit than Lisp**, **lighter than monadic Haskell**, and **more expressive in trace semantics** than Prolog’s backtracking model.
- Unlike theorem provers (e.g. Coq, Lean), LEE is not constructing proofs from axioms but **evaluating logical forms** through symbol flow and contextual binding.
- The state phases introduce semantics to traditionally vacuous truths (e.g., `0 → 1`), allowing for **phase-coherent evaluation**:
  - `ALIVE` — functional inference proceeds
  - `JAM` — a structural contradiction halts progress
  - `MEM` — suspended inference is remembered as context
  - `VAC` — undefined evaluation space remains consistent with null structure

This enables LEE to model recursive forms (like the Y-Combinator) within a traceable, pedagogically clear symbolic framework.

## Why It Matters

LEE's innovation lies not in redefining logic, but in **rendering evaluation visible** as a semantically structured symbolic cycle. This layered interpretive model is:

- **Unique** in logic toolchains
- **Applicable** to teaching and symbolic AI
- **Extensible** for modal and temporal logic use

## Strategic Position

Phase evaluation will remain **modular** within LEE — quietly powering its evaluation core — while more familiar features (e.g., substitution, lambda evaluation, memory modeling) lead traction with researchers and educators.

This avoids detours while preserving a conceptual edge for future growth.
