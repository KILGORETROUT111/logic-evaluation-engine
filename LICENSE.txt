# Logic Evaluation Engine â€“ Phase-Resolved Diagnostic Inference

This release documents and discloses the novel logical architecture, rotation mechanism, and inference structure behind the Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE). Specifically:

- Covariant phase-based truth rotation: `mem â†’ alive â†’ jam â†’ mem`
- Conjugate contradiction tracking and forked evaluation branches
- Phase-state rotation and logical resolution engine geometry
- Diagnostic trace memory coherence and inference probes
- Dual-mode implementation: CLI + RESTful endpoint logic

## Purpose of Disclosure

This bundle constitutes a formal **defensive disclosure** and **licensing declaration** for intellectual property protection. It places the key mechanisms of LEE into the public record under a limited demonstration and diagnostic license (LEE-LDDL v1.1), with all commercial rights reserved to the author.

It includes:

- Provisional patent
- Reference code snapshots and output traces
- License declaration: `LICENSE.txt` (LEE-LDDL v1.1)

The Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) Core â€” including code and modules in /evaluation, /core, /utils â€”
is licensed under a RESTRICTED-USE license.

You MAY:
- View, fork, and study the source code for research, academic, and personal use.

You MAY NOT:
- Embed LEE in any commercial system, proprietary platform, or automated inference product.
- Use LEE as a backend for legaltech, medtech, AI, or decision-making tools intended for deployment.

This repository initially used GPL-3.0 as a placeholder license during early research development,
pending clarification of intellectual property boundaries. As of this revision, LEE is designated
as a restricted-use system under bespoke licensing terms.

If you wish to deploy or embed LEE in a commercial, governmental, or AI-integrated application,
please contact:

Violation of this license may result in legal action.

## Usage Rights

The Logic Evaluation Engine and its documented inference system may be evaluated, tested, and reviewed for **non-commercial purposes**. Derivative or commercial use is **explicitly prohibited** without written consent of the author.
