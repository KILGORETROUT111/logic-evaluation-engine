✅ Best Practices to Preserve Indentation When Copying from AI Output
Here are 4 foolproof ways to make sure indents are retained:

✅ 1. Use a Code-Friendly Editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime)
These editors detect indentation inconsistencies automatically.

They can also convert tabs to spaces and vice versa (more below).

VS Code shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I (auto-indent selection).

✅ 2. Always Paste into a Blank Area or Use Paste Special
In VS Code: Right-click > “Paste without formatting” (avoids tabs being misinterpreted).

Or: Paste into a blank new .py file and compare it side-by-side with your original file.

✅ 3. Convert Tabs to Spaces or Vice Versa
Most Python style guides (like PEP8) recommend 4 spaces, not tabs.

In VS Code:

Click on “Spaces: 4” or “Tab Size: 4” in the bottom bar.

Select: Convert Indentation to Spaces.

✅ 4. Use black or autopep8 to Reformat Automatically
You can auto-fix indentation with tools:

pip install black
black path/to/your_file.py

This will:

Correct any indentation mismatches.

Normalize structure to standard Python formatting.

🧪 Diagnostic Tip: Run a Minimal Check
After pasting, run a dry test like:

python
Copy
Edit
if True:
    print("Test")
If this throws a syntax error, your file has a hidden indent issue (like a tab mixed with spaces).

If you ever need me to output indented code as a downloadable .py file, just ask:

🗂️ “Please generate this as a downloadable file.”

Would you like the current go() function and surrounding logic as a .py file to guarantee format fidelity?
