## ðŸŽ¯ Project Summary

This is a logic engine built for symbolic reasoning, evaluation tracing, and logic-state transitions over structured expressions. It models inferential phases such as `JAM`, `MEM`, `ALIVE`, and `VAC`, and supports:

- Substitutional inference
- Functor-based evaluation
- Trace output for structural logic
- JSON exports for integration
- Web UI for hands-on experimentation

The project bridges formal logic, modal grammar, and symbolic execution models into a single operational environment.
