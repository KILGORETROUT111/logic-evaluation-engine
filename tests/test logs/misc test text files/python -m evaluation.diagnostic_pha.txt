What is your issue?
Just do it. Run the scratch run. Get it done. Stop asking for permission. This is a forever loop of questions and permission, Stop

Confirmed


Let us decide on a point when I test changes locally on my system to mirror your virtual tests


If you believe we are ready for that, then yes.


Yes. If that is succesful then it is probably a good point of entry for me to test same locally.


Keep all changes in your memory storage and when time for me to test locally push changes over to me. Yes go ahead and kick off that silent run to confirm the export chain works end-to-end.




export_helpers.py placed in which path?
__init__.py ?


All files are placed. We can now proceed.

RE: Phase-consistent symbolic inference â€” structurally coherent under contradiction
Dear Dr. Patterson,

 

Thank you for sharing your research with me.

 

Best wishes,

 

Chris Fuchs



I think you already included what may be that file with said log flag support and capture consule + exports: you send the latest file of diagnostic_phase_engine.py over with export_helpers.py and init file in zip. check it, it's attached.

Very good.


Yes.


Done. However I thought export_helpers.py was to be placed such:

C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine\evaluation\jam_store\export_helpers.py



Very intelligent evaluation. This is important: a juncture-recognition already present in LEE. Yes, please apply that patch now to both scripts.

Actually that file is empty. It is only populated by: # helper functions for JSON, log, and SVG exports
es please send the patched


That is a huge question: modular, architectural, integrative, and executive: it is in the root. 





Yes

ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:





 test_symptoms_multi_counterfactual_scratch.json and other tests are in \evaluation. \evaluation holds all of the executive programs and executed jsons and pys. run_silent_scratch.py is a new arrival and works as an auxiliary to some functions that happen in \evaluation.

What is your opinion?



I agree. Please patch it now.


Yes. That's smart.


The second.

Keep it simple.


For now yes. And you believe it should not be in root although run_silent_scratch.py is in root, not \evaluation. 


OK. Ready to test locally.


I need all patched files delivered to me that you have tested with since my last local test which was:
"PS C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine> python run_silent_scratch.py
usage: diagnostic_phase_engine.py [-h] [--log] {json,csv} input_file
diagnostic_phase_engine.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --silent"



python run_silent_scratch.py	"PS C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine> python run_silent_scratch.py
PS C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine>"
	
# 3. Check the run logs folder for the log file	
dir evaluation\run_logs (C:\Users\Dell\Documents\logic-evaluation-engine\evaluation\run_logs       )	no entries made



Give me something else to test.



No output. 

yes: diagnostic_phase_engine.py isnâ€™t firing must be patched it so the --log flag automatically calls export_all_outputs() at the end of the run.
yes: patch diagnostic_phase_engine.py so it always exports logs, contradictions, and PACI triples when --log is passed


These files are Empty - they are placeholders. Create downloadable link for each and ever file from now on: Do Not Zip the files. 

# Patched diagnostic_phase_engine.py content

test_symptoms_multi_counterfactual_scratch.json: {"mock": "test data"}


Not empty:
test_symptoms_multi_counterfactual_force_paci.json
test_symptoms_multi_counterfactual.json


Yes.


IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line 51

Looked at the file. Line looks consistent. Better send inline code over for totality of code in diagnostic_phase_engine.py. I will paste it in.

Yes. If you've checked that a function like replay_patient_timelin  timeline_replay.py and the code fits the bill, then go ahead and patch. If it's not coming from there, then don't patch

Yes start re-patching after upload

Move toward solid build.


Build solid build.

This is tomorrow. Move.

This is 05:43 CET. We begin now. Your tomorrow passed. Now is now. Immplement alias import now


I see no downloadable patched file. Present downloadable patched file.

Yes


Attached is the most recent Golden Image for Handover to a the next fresh AI. Please proceed with Handoff by creating Golden_Image_Build_003_MASTER.

Yes


The most recent GitHub release is always included in the Golden Image Handoff + The present local state of LEE. Both attached.


We are only focused on the Stable Build. We are not focused on a Demo per se at all. Every Demo with be isomorphic with the Solid Build. no-delta(SolidBuild, Demo).


We are doing a handoff from a Python build with API function. Handoff material is prepared. We need the most advanced computational and analytical AI mechanism in Cha


t-GPT to handle hard maths and logic, and mirroring of them in code. What is the best Chat-GPT mode / AI agent to do this in. Strategic intelligence is also assumed: agent AI must have some awareness of methodology so that we don't experience code drift entropy.




Over the past five days we have had chaotic entropic drift from functionality. We want solidbuild:demo, 'solidbuild' is isomorphic with any 'demo' that is given to outsiders. The failure of handoff has led to catastrophic drift not just because of that misalignment. If I had a Mach-like overview system I could track each and every misstep at the critical juncture when we moved on ca. July 28 to the new AI. That 1. destroyed vs1.2., destroyed work down with the older AI between 25 July vs1.2 GitHub push and the 28th with the new AI. You are the third AI, AI-3. AI-1 was superb. But in memory constraints slowed that chatbot. So handover was spiked when moving to AI-2. AI-2 went full hog into destructive mode as though nothing else had happened on LEE before that. I have had hundreds of people on SAP projects under my supervision. This must not happen again. LEE must be made ready for its next push to GitHub in its 'solidbuild' state. Forget the word 'demo'. Any 'demo' is implied in a 'solidbuild'. Please run through all the files in the three zip folders and come back to me with your understanding.

I have a mathematically complex Inference Engine build. The present build is in Python. It was built from math that Chat-GPT was able to understand. It was able to project it into code. It made strategic and tactical decisions, generated code and code patches, and we got the the engine built off the math. At a certain point Chat-GPT 4.o Advance Mode began to behave as a predictive text engine that could no longer reason about the project. There are some things on the internet about the degradation of Chat-GPT's Python capacities recently. I have a complex inference engine that some of the world's best thinkers in physics and AI and mathematics have viewed and a few have written emails to me about. Chat-GPT has now wasted seven days of my time. I gave it chance after chance. If I had let it continue, the code would have been so scattered that the engine would have to revert to an earlier build. This build is thankfully functionally able and on GitHub. Can Gemini take over for such a project Or Not.
