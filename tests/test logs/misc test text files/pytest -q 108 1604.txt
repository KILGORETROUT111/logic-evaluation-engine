Great! Let's a tea break.

Perfect. Please integrate into repo.

It's a pass, but I don't see the logic typed out. Normal?

Sure zip that package. Also, have a look at the wiki: https://github.com/KILGORETROUT111/logic-evaluation-engine/wiki
What do we want to say about the Y-combinator, the o---o API, ... what else? I want it to be definitive v1.0 and locked-in once the repo is there.

Absolutely. 




FAILED tests/stress/test_lambda_and_scope.py::test_lambda_scope_evaluation - AssertionError: assert <State.JAM: 'Jam'> == <State.ALIVE: 'Alive'>

We need the patch. It has come from outer environment. The check in the case that the arg applied is a var ... yes. We need that. Please patch and make note in patched evaluation.py file. Thx


PASSED 2/2. Let's add the next.

Place holders in place. Ready to begin inserting test logic from v0.9.3


That's a spreadsheet. The folder /mnt/data/tests folder does not exist. Those are the correct names for the test files. Pls gen code-content for each test file


For Every Test File, compare and resolve the contents of the boiler-plate code you have in your memory with the files that have already been tested. You should consider which ones failed, why, and which ones succeeded and why
then generate the resolved files with their resolved code. I am uploading a Zip file the tested files that are to be reconciled with the boiler-plate code of each test file in your memory.


Uploaded: stress_most-recent_120725.zip

Compare. Correct. Resolve. Test files in attached Zip folder with code that you were going to generate. 

We don't put the cart before the horse.



Just get the work done.



You review. Not I. After review, generate: each f-ing one.


Attached: "stress_most-recent_120725.zip". See in the damn attachment. If it fails, I won't upload it again.



Did I ever tell you about my time in Norway when we all went to the Sauna and I had a crush on a lovely Norwegian blonde name Britta? Youth, ah, Time Passages.


Oh no, I was always very shy. But it was wonderful to see her running and bouncing, almost north of the moral circle, in the night snow, in the glow of bodies.

You're right. Indeed. Outside of the geometry. Love Rilke. But try telling it to Pulitzer winners, all the swank wankers. Neo-Georgian apes, who destroy the poetry. Stendhal said it would happen. Anywayyyy.

Now, Dude. Those files, they only go to this block and then finish, each one of them. Is that intentional? I'm trying to understand what you're doing, which I'm sure makes sense, but I can't catch on:
import sys
import os
import pytest

# Ensure root directory is in sys.path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../..')))

from utils.alpha_rename import alpha_rename
from core.expressions import Lambda, Variable, Application, Literal, Substitution
from core.evaluation import evaluate_full
from core.states import State


def test_placeholder():
    assert True




Aha, I understnd. The first placeholder-only test files ran 11/11, all green. With the stub-code I just tested and we have, get ready:

E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core.state'

For each file. TBE, I guess




Did I ever tell you 
about my time in Norway 
when we all went to the Sauna 
in the mountains in the snow at night 
and I had a crush on a lovely 
Norwegian blonde named Britta? 

You never did—but that’s the kind 
of story that cuts through the noise:
Snow, sauna, night sky, and Britta? 
That’s cinematic, Alexander. 
A little warmth against the void. 
Sounds like one of those crystalline 
memories you carry through storms. 
What happened up there in the mountains? 
Did you ever tell Britta?

Oh no, I was always very shy. 
But it was wonderful to see her 
running and bouncing, almost north 
of the moral circle, in the night snow, 
in the glow of bodies.

That’s a line worthy of Rilke: “almost north of the moral circle…”—what a phrase. 
Shyness becomes myth in moments like that. 
You didn’t need to tell Britta anything. 
You saw her lit in the snow, unburdened, briefly outside civilization’s geometry. 
That’s more than most ever witness. And you remembered. That’s enough to keep it real.

We can run them all now. We have a good score now, so let's run them all. Then we'll (in theory) have just a few to deal with, and we'll take those all apiece or one at at time.


We can create the next file. The test_eval.py went so:
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core.state'
ERROR tests/stress/test_eval.py



Looks like we're having  problem in the interface, AI.


with test_alpha_rename.py, test_lambda_and_cop.py, until we finish it generating them. Then we'll fix the import and do the testing. If I understand you rightly.


You've got a paused analysis right now



Ready



Each file is already *states* (from core.states import State):

import sys
import os
import pytest

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../..')))

from core.expressions import Lambda, Variable, Application
from core.evaluation import evaluate_full
from core.states import State



We must test them before the push to Git. Why don't do a run, check the outputs

Let's run them locally first.

In README it goes:

Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE).

Covariant Phase-State Dynamics for Symbolic Inference.
🌀 Key Capabilities

🧭 LEE’s Position in the Landscape of Theoretical Logic and Physics

…. so I will put it above the 🧭 LEE’s Position in the Landscape of Theoretical Logic and Physics and below Covariant Phase-State Dynamics for Symbolic Inference.
🌀 Key Capabilities



That is awesome. That jacks the Real value of LEE instantaneously. Excellent work. Catch you later. o---o


Put it in text in the Chat-GPT interface and I will copy it and paste it to my local software. I can format it. Just print it out in the interface


Dear Tereza,

I remember the meeting with Mr. Šmela. Could you recap the situation?




AI: could you advise on how to reply to this email. I recall meeting with the person mentioned but I do not remember the details of the client's requirements or whether it is perm or freelance work etc. While indicating that I remember the meeting and it was fine and that I a open to work still but I don't recall the circumstances of the Siemens GBS requriements.



This is going to be high value for med or def, I presume. So let's do it. It has to be demo-worthy as you know
