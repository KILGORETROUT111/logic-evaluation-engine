## 🚀 Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE) — v3.1-pre-grant

This is the pre‑grant milestone for LEE — a phase‑geometry inference engine for counterfactual reasoning and diagnostic evaluation.

### 🔹 Key Innovations
- Original contributions (W.A. Patterson):
  - Phase‑geometry mapping from material implication truth tables
  - Identity of conjugate quantities in logical systems
  - StressIndex, Winding, Resistance metrics
- Externally inspired refinement (attributed):
  - Logical Bianchi Identity v2 (conservation analogue + residual audit)

### 📊 Demonstrated Capabilities
- StressIndex — strain in logical flow
- Resistance — persistence of strain
- Bianchi Residual — conservation of contradiction current
- Reproducible: metrics computed from provenance logs

### 🛠 Current Status
- Working engine, docs, tests
- Provenance logging wired
- Example smoke runs available

### 🌍 Applications & Impact
- Medical diagnostics, legal reasoning, AI safety (stability under contradiction)

### 📅 Next (6–12 months if funded)
1. Time‑weighted StressIndex
2. Manifold distortion analysis
3. Applied pilots (medical/legal)
