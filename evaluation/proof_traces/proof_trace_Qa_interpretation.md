# ‚öñÔ∏èüß¨ A Simplex Derivation ‚Äî Applying LEE to Law and Medicine

This is a symbolic inference trace generated by the Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE v1.1), interpreted in **two real-world domains**:

---

## üî¢ Base Logical Form

**Axiom A1**: `¬¨P(x) ‚à® Q(x)`  
(Equivalent to `P(x) ‚Üí Q(x)`)

**Known Fact**: `P(a)`  
**Derived**: `Q(a)`

This was resolved by **disjunctive syllogism**:
> From: `¬¨P(a) ‚à® Q(a)` and `P(a)`  
> We infer: `Q(a)`

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Interpretation

- Let `P(x)` = "Defendant violated a statutory duty (e.g., failed informed consent)"
- Let `Q(x)` = "Court must treat the breach as material in law"

**Then**:  
> If the defendant violated their duty, the court is required to evaluate the breach as material.

**Derived**:  
> `Material Breach(a)` follows from `Duty Violation(a)`  
> under axiom A1 = `¬¨DutyViolation(x) ‚à® MaterialBreach(x)`

This logic underlies many tort, civil, and constitutional findings where *implication from fact ‚Üí legally binding consequence* is core.

## ü©∫ Medical Interpretation

- Let `P(x)` = "Symptom X is present in patient"
- Let `Q(x)` = "Diagnostic trigger for condition X fires"

**Then**:  
> If Symptom(a) is observed, system must infer or escalate to Diagnostic(a)

LEE's inference:
> `TriggerDiagnosis(a)` follows from `Symptom(a)`  
> via the medical axiom `¬¨Symptom(x) ‚à® TriggerDiagnosis(x)`

This links directly into the LEE Medical Use Case.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Structural Summary

| Symbol | Legal Meaning                    | Medical Meaning                 |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `P(x)` | Duty violated                    | Symptom present                 |
| `Q(x)` | Material breach must be found    | Diagnostic trigger must fire    |
| `¬¨P(x) ‚à® Q(x)` | Legal or medical rule of implication | Diagnostic or liability axiom  |
| `P(a)` | Observed duty breach             | Observed symptom in patient     |
| `Q(a)` | Court or system must respond     | Diagnosis must be evaluated     |

## üß† From Symbol to Action

This symbolic resolution demonstrates how LEE can:
- Formalize **legal logic** structures
- Emulate **diagnostic logic** processes
- Deliver transparent, justifiable inference traces
