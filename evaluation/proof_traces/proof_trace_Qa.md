# Logic Proof Trace â€“ Goal: Q(a)

**Result**: âœ… *Derived via disjunctive syllogism*

---

## ðŸ§  Trace

1. Given fact: `P(a)`
2. Axiom A1: `Â¬P(x) âˆ¨ Q(x)`
3. Substitution applied: `{x â†’ a}`
4. Instantiated axiom: `Â¬P(a) âˆ¨ Q(a)`
5. Disjunction Evaluation:
   - `Â¬P(a)` = False
   - `Q(a)` = False
6. âœ… **Conclusion**: `Q(a)` derived via disjunctive syllogism on A1
