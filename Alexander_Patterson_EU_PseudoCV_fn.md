## üîç Current Project Work (Jan 2025‚ÄìPresent)

I‚Äôve been developing a symbolic reasoning engine for complex diagnostic and logic-driven inference use cases.  
The project is called the **Logic Evaluation Engine (LEE)** ‚Äî designed to handle ambiguity, contradictory inputs, and inference resolution across multi-domain systems.

It‚Äôs applicable in areas like:
- AI/ML-supported logic validation in SAP S/4HANA (e.g. pricing, diagnostics, SLT flows)
- Medical or causal reasoning pipelines
- Formal logic + geometric phase-state systems
